The Weather App allows users to fetch weather information either by granting location access or by searching for a specific city. When the app loads, users can grant location access to get weather details for their current location, which is retrieved using the browser's geolocation feature. Alternatively, users can enter a city name to search for weather data. The app communicates with the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather information and displays it, including temperature, humidity, windspeed, and cloud cover. The interface features loading indicators and handles errors gracefully to enhance user experience.
